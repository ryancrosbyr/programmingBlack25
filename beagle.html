    <p>The Beagle is a small breed of scent hound, 
    similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
    The beagle was developed primarily for hunting rabbit or hare,
    known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior
    tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a 
    detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs 
    in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a 
    popular pet due to its size and amiable temperament.</p>
